Assuming you have python installed <br>
Step 1: <br>
Create a python virtual environment <br>
You can follow <br>
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/

Step 2: <br>
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr.git <br>

And their face detection model: <br>
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F_flSdZQNCb3URiiZMpSrU_aQe7bktmS/view?usp=drive_link (put into detr directory) <br>

Step 3: <br>
move files from src into detr (not putting src the folder into detr) <br>
and go into detr

Step 4: <br>
install necessary libraries

Step 5: <br>
run <br>
python app.py <br>
in the terminal and then following the link you can locally access the webpage

Step 6: <br>
Since the model goes through videos frame-by-frame, it may take a few minutes <br>
or even longer depending on the size of your files <br>
You can go to detr/static/processed to view the videos after evaluated by the <br>
model
